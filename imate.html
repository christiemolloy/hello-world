        The process of waking up in the morning is utterly different for everyone. However, the iPhone is currently limited to the same restricted wake-up process for everyone. The alarm sounds, they check the time and their notifications, they possibly read the news or open Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat to see what they missed overnight. They could be in a new city so they plan what to do that day, or maybe they attempt a new workout.  Basically, the iPhone controls millions of users mornings, but the time has come for customization. Meet the future. Meet your new mate: iMate. Wake up in the morning with a friend, an instructor, or a guide and her name isn’t Siri; Siri is down-right annoying. Be excited to wake up in the morning on the right path with your new friend. Once the alarm sounds, rather than sliding to unlock, users can slide to start their morning. They will be greeted with their favourite quote, the weather in their city today, and a list of their notifications from overnight. Following from that, it is all fully customizable with over 200 different options to include in the morning depending on the amount of time they have in the morning and their personality, interests and goals.
