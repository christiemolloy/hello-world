        <h1>What if the percent of females interning in tech was 50?</h1>

        <h2>There would only be positive outcomes for society. During my internship at Twitter I created the initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/TerningTheTable">@TerningTheTable</a>: a campaign to increase the percentage of females interning in tech. Our goal is to #GetTo50 (percent) with a healthy number of URM's and engineering roles. We will do this by fostering a community of female students in tech and those who aren't in order to reach our goal.</h2>

 beauty, money, fast food, and politics. By using the scanner to distort material, I was able to create distortion in multiple senses.</h2>

        <h1>What if "Donald Trump" is removed from the end of his quotes?</h1>

            <h2>People break out in fury. Turns out CNN did a good job at normalizing Trump's voice. I created this campaign, not based on my political views, but as an experiment on students at college. When students at Boston University found the quotes from my campaign they took to social media to explain their disgust. When they learned that it was in fact Trump who said them, it made them think hard about their Presidential vote.
