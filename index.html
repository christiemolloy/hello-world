        <h1>What if the percent of females interning in tech was 50?</h1>

        <h2>There would be many positive outcomes for society. I created the initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/TerningTheTable">@TerningTheTable</a>: a campaign to increase the percentage of females interning in tech. Our goal is to #GetTo50 (percent) with a healthy number of URM's and engineering roles. We will do this by fostering a community of female students in tech and those who aren't in order to reach our goal.</h2>

            <h2>People break out in fury. Turns out CNN did a good job at normalizing Trump's voice. So when students at Boston Uiversity found the quotes they took to social media to explain their disgust. When they learned that it was in fact Trump who said them, they thought twice when it came to Election Day.

We were assigned the task of creating a series of four posters to be hung on election day: one for Hillary, one against Hillary, one for Trump and one against Trump. It was exciting to play an active role in the community and to voice my opinion.</h2>
