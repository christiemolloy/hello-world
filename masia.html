        <p>‘Make America Say it Again’ is a response to Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign. By utilizing the power of design, I sourced direct quotes that Trump has stated over the recent years and positioned them in locations around Boston University that furthered how immoral, racist or just plain absurd they are. By forcing Americans to “say it” again, the project serves to remind students of words that the potential next future President of America, Donald Trump, believes in. I removed Trump’s name from the quotes. The more anonymous they were, the higher the shock value, and the more people would realize how immoral Trump’s words are. If I were to have included Trump’s name in the quote, my project would have paralleled with any news article or CNN report, and people would have thought “classic Trump” as they walked by the quote. But take away “Trump”, and the shock value restarts. None of the quotes are intended to offend or hurt people, they are only meant to remind and inform students of Donald Trump’s statements. I definitely didn’t expect this project to attract so much attention. I understood that people would react negatively to the quotes and take them down, but I definitely undervalued the powerful impact social media can play in certain events and in certain places. So far the campaign has been featured on two articles by ‘The Tab’, see links below, one which received over 800 shares and 2500 views. People have taken photos and posted them to facebook, instagram, and snapchat and someone even created their own hashtag for the project. The project was a success and even though I received a lot of negative attention and questioning, I would do it over again.
