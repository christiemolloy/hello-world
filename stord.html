        The idea first came to me when I was shopping with my mom and as I was taking the grocery bags at the checkout I was handed my receipt. I subsequently scrunched up the receipt and threw it in the trash. It was at that moment I posed the question “why do paper receipts still exist?” They are useless, wasteful and inefficient, and currently, there is not one application that makes receipts interactive. Yes you can view receipts online, but can you actually USE your receipt. The ideal user would be frequent grocery shopper (mom), however the application would be used by anyone who shops and cares about their budget.At the checkout, once the user has swiped their card, they can open their Stor’d app and view their most recent receipt. They can click on any item on the receipt taking them to their weekly, monthly and yearly spending on that item group. It will show them where they could have bought it cheaper and allow them to add it to their future shopping list in a certain amount of days. This automatically creates the second function of the app for the user: a virtual shopping list. Stor’d will calculate, based on all the items in the shopping list, where to shop based on the lowest total price of all items. Stor’d not only benefits the user by saving them money, but it also benefits stores. They are able to log into the application and view accumulated shopping lists based on the region they select. For example, a store manager can log in to Stor’d and view the accumulated shopping list for all users in the Boston area ranked in order of the most popular items. Currently, there is no other way for stores to determine consumers’ future purchases, other than basing it off of past trends. Stores will be able to administer specials and savings on those items which are deemed most popular for the next week. Stor’d becomes valuable for both consumers and retailers.
