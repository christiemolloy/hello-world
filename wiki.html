            My name is Christie Molloy and I am a student at Boston University. I transferred from Brisbane, Australia a year and a half ago. While it has been a rollercoaster ride since coming to school here, it has been the best decision of my life. In this webpage I talk about why leaving home is both the best and hardest thing you can do but I encourage everyone...

            No one’s schedule is college is the same. My particular schedule has been very different from friends’ – so I often will find myself studying late at night alone, eating food between classes alone, spending Sunday’s in the library alone or taking transport alone. Back at home my house was constantly filled with family and guests, or if I was out of the house I would be in classes with friends and taking transport with them. There was never time to be alone. Being alone, despite how productive it can be, is also very daunting and isolating most of the time. Time spent alone allows you to question and overthink things that don’t matter. You question whether you have enough friends, you question if you are social enough and you question whether you should go back home. When you’re alone you cry; you cry a lot. And it’s only when you’re comfortable with being alone that you can be truly happy.

            Being alone means choosing what you want to do rather than what you think you should be doing. You learn what you like and what you don’t like. You get down time. You appreciate your friends more because when you do get to see them, you treasure the moment. And you are more productive because you suddenly have more time than you ever had before. Your self-discovery begins the moment you can tap out of the social network and tap into the inner you. When I lived alone in New York over the Summer I never once felt lonely. But here in college it’s so easy to be overwhelmed by the vast amount of social interactions that occur. And if you can train yourself to not be overwhelmed by them – your time will be significantly better.

            Heading into college I believed I could survive a long distance relationship - and I survived – but it didn’t last long. Living 16 hours apart from someone is tough. At the beginning you grow stronger as a couple because talking becomes much more infrequent and so you treasure the time you do have. But after around six weeks, trust issues arise as you meet new people and go out more. You feel trapped and controlled as you begin to question why you’re still in this constricting relationship. Your freedom is taken away; and for what price? You don’t even get to see the person you love. You start to hate them and this hate turns passionate. But it’s only two weeks until you see them and so you get excited. This cycle continues until you reach the breaking point and [you hate the fact you love them. Watching a relationship that was so good turning into something so bad is one of the hardest things I have done.

            As I said goodbye to my best friends at home, I remember thinking ‘I’m about to have a new best friend and to my future best friend: I can’t wait to meet you!’ A few weeks into college I thought how much I really appreciated me friends back home because people in college were not turning out to be anything like them. But as the weeks progressed, so too did the friendships. In college its easy to stay up late together because you only live a few streets away, to eat three meals a day together because you both have an unlimited meal plan and to party together on the weekend because you heard of the one Frat Party that’s. I have been here for just over a year and some of the connections that I have made are already deeper than I could have imagined.

            <p>
            You don’t go to your favorite food place just for the food. You go there for the ambience, the energy and the vibes. It’s easy to replace a slice of pizza, a sushi roll or a milkshake, but it’s impossible to recreate the feeling you get from a good restaurant. Back at home breakfast is everything. It’s where you meet with your friends, where you go to take a cool Instagram photo, and where your boyfriend takes you on Sunday morning. But here at college, breakfast means scrambled eggs and home fries in the Dining Hall after a night out. Where is the ambience? I cant take a cool picture of this meal.

            College food is a lot different to the food that I have back home. It’s arguably unhealthier, but it sure does taste great! Not being able to eat at your favourite restaurant forces you to try different cuisines, different dishes, and different restaurants. Your taste palette grows and your knowledge of local restaurants widens. You become more intact with culture than ever before.

            I touch down at the airport where I had said my goodbyes over 11 months ago. The architecture, the advertisements, the accents; they all feel so familiar. I’m excited because nothing has changed and I can slip right back in. But as I catch up with friends in larger settings, I start to realize that I cannot assimilate with them like I used to 11 months ago. They refer to events, new friends and different guys that I wasn’t apart of or have no clue about. Some friends I haven’t even spoken to at all. I feel distant, unwanted and an outsider to people I was so close with. Was it my fault I didn’t keep in contact, or was it just the nature of the beast. Suddenly I felt distant from both my friends back in college and my home friends.

            Away from large group settings I catch up with my best friends. We can talk for hours about things that I can relate to it feels natural and so comfortable.

With them, 11 months feels like only a week. And I begin to realize that these are the friends I will keep with me forever.

            <p>
            I always thought of the definition of ‘goodbye’ as: ‘by for now, but see you soon’. Turns out when I have to say goodbye, there’s a good chance I won’t see that person for weeks, months or even many years. Saying goodbye to my family is probably the hardest. I don’t go home for Winter Break on purpose because I know how hard saying goodbye will be. I made best friends during my summer Internship in New York, but after 2 months of spending 40 hours a week together, we had to come to terms with the fact that we were all going back to different states. When would we see each other? Possibly in New York again after graduation. But would we ever be as close? Probably not.

            <p>
            Living in multiple places means that becoming too close with friends makes saying goodbye infinitely harder. It’s easier to get by with relationships that are not too involved, especially when moving around a lot. Saying goodbye definitely becomes easier. You learn not to cry, because crying will not fix anything. You be strong, you give them a hug, you say ‘see you soon!’ and be on your way. Work hard: it will make them proud. Check in with them: it will make them happy. Be inspired by them: that will keep them in your life. You’ll soon learn that people don’t have to be physically present to be present in your mind. Memories trump everything. But physical presence is necessary to form those memories.

            ‘You’re getting an art degree? You should be doing business; business is where the money is. I’m not paying for college if you’re only taking art classes.’ We are nurtured through a system our whole life (elementary school, middle school, high school, college, work and retirement), so sometimes it seems absurd to stray away from the norm. You have to trust yourself when no one else trusts what you’re doing. Keep focused towards your goal, because if you aren’t focused, your plan will unfold. I have felt doubt before from my parents and peers. But I use this doubt to fuel my drive. Leaving home is hard, but being doubted can be even harder.

            I have learnt that success doesn’t correlate with money, for now, atleast. You have to take several steps on your way to the top that don’t necessarily result in money. But each success is a step forward. Thinking that each step should involve money can result in a step backwards. For example, taking an unpaid internship is far more valuable than taking a job at a convenience store just for the sake of money. I’m lucky to have a great support network, but it took me a while to convince them that their investment would eventually “pay” off one day. I’m still yet to reach the day that I will start to pay it off, but I know that every step I take is in the right direction.

            Your friends see 5-10% of what you do, and you can’t blame them for assuming that is all you’re doing. It’s hard not to create an ideal image for yourself because it’s so easy to do so on social media. But it turns out that portraying the wrong image can attract the wrong types of people. If you portray an accurate representation, your friends will appreciate that and be able to identify with you more.
